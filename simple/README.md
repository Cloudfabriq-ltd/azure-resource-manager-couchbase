# Simple

This is a simple ARM template that deploys a single datacenter of Couchbase.  You will need to [install version 2 of the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2). To run this from the Azure CLI use the command:

    ./deploy.sh <some resource group name>

The deploy command will create a resource group.  It will then create a deployment within that resource group.
